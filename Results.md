## 1. **Arm Length Variation**

  In the gravitational wave detectors, the strain h(f) is calculated in order to understand the sensitivity. The formula is given by:
  
  ### $h(f) = \frac{\delta L}{L}$

  On rearranging we get,

  ### $\delta L = h \times L$

Thus, longer the arm length, more will be the displacement induced. Thus, it will be easier to detect the subtle signals. Increasing the arm length improves the sensitivity in the low-mid frequency bandwidth. Therefore, third generation detectors such as LISA, ET and CE are designed with much longer arm length.

## 2. **Laser Power Variation**

One of the dominant noise in the gravitational wave detectors is Quantum Noise. It is sub-divided into two parts: Quantum Radiation Pressure Noise (dominant in lower frequency region) and Quantum Shot Noise (dominant in higher frequency region). The relation between the strain $h(f)$ and Laser Power $P_L$ mentioned in [*Vajente *et al.* (2019)*](https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.aamop.2019.04.002) is given by:

### $h_{sn} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt {P_L}}$
and
### $h_{rp} \propto {\sqrt {P_L}}$

Thus, increasing laser power decreases quantum shot noise in the higher frequency region. But on the contrary, quantum radiation pressure noise shows significant increase.
